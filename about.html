            <h2>Why make this site?</h2>
            <p>I personally feel that there is a lot of robot history that is being lost to time. Whether it be robot conventions that were only reported on in physical media such as magazines, or old sites that are hard to find or exist only on the Internet Archive, most of this is fading away, especially with the new shiny robots appearing left and right. There needs to be a place for it to live on. At the moment, I'm only one person, but I will continue to dig through the weeds, collecting old media and spelunking down ancient internet rabitholes, reporting and documenting what I find.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Why does the site look so old?</h2>
            <p>The entire site uses only HTML and CSS. Not a fan of JavaScript. Sure there might be some parts of the site that can be improved with JavaScript, but I find my current way of doing things keeps the site low profile and easy to navigate.</p>

            <h2>Sitewide Info</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>There might be pages with little to no information, blank pages, unfinished pages, links that don't go anywhere or to pages you weren't expecting. The site is a constant work in progress, I add to it when I have time or have found some big information. Some pages are placeholders for future work.</li>
                <li>I only use the highest resolution version of any given image, so page loading times may take longer.</li>
                <li>I have a backup of every video that is used on this site that are hosted on external platforms. So, if for any reason a video gets taken down by the hosting platform or it's publishers, I can reupload and replace it's source on the page.</li>
                <li>I try to include as many links to references as possible. I do a lot of research, I want to leave a trail back to where everything is found.</li>
                <li>I try to keep the speculation down to a minimum, however, with how old most these robots are and how little information there is on them, a little educated guessing is made. I make it known explicitly when I am engaging in speculation so that there is no confusion on the solid details.</li>
