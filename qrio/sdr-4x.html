            <h3>Hardware</h3>
            <p>SDR-4X is a bit taller than its predecessor SDR-3X, with new measurements: width = 26 cm, height = 58 cm, depth = 19 cm, weight = 6.5 kg. It also has a greater degree of freedom: 38 DOF</p>
            <img src="https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2002/0319/sony303.jpg" class="center-image">
            <p>New actuators have been developed: ISA-4S, ISA-4M, ISA-4MH, ISA-4SS. Compared to the actuators used in SDR-3X, starting torque has increased by approximately 30%, rated torque by approximately 15%, and efficiency by approximately 20%. Overall, this makes it's movements smoother and more responsive.</p>

            <p>The head contains stereo cameras and an infrared distance sensor located on the forhead bump. The LEDs around it's "eyes" have 4096 variations, and it's "ears" light up 16 shades of white, indicating emotions. To display a larger range of emotions, the head/neck have 4 DOF, 3 in the head for roll, pitch and yaw, 1 at the base of the neck to tilt the neck forward.</p>
            <p>Also located in the head are 7 microphones for registering voice commands in 360 degrees.</p>

            <p>Each hand has 5 fingers, all individually actuated. The fingers open and close by miniature gears transmitting along the length of the finger. There are also an infrared distance sensor on the top of each hand facing forward.</p>
            <p>On the inside of both arms are switches that prevent the arm from pinching something when it is closing.</p>
            <img src="https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2002/0319/sony329.jpg" class="center-image">
            <p>The robot also has an integraded handle on it's back where you can pick up and carry the robot. Underneath the handle is a "lift sensor", which is a button that when the robot is lifted, cuts power to all of the actuators for safe transportation.</p>

            <p>Behind the neck are communication jacks.</p>
            <p>It's 12V lithium ion battery is located can last for 1 hour and is located in it's chest. You can flip down it's chest cover to reveil the battery compartment and card slots. SDR-4X has both a Memory Stick slot and a PC Card (type-II) slot.</p>

            <h3>Software</h3>
            <p>With SDR-4X having stereo cameras, it can detect the distance between itself and an object, and can also identify faces it has stored in it's database.</p>
            <p>Using it's wireless LAN, it can sync to an external PC which facilitates in SDR-4X's speech recognition capabilities, recognizing between 50,000 and 60,000 words.<sup><a href="#cn-01">[1]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Similar to AIBO, SDR-4X has a personality. If it is knocked over, it will respond with "that hurts!", then precede to get up. It's eyes and ears light up different colors to show different emotions. It can play games like rock, paper, scissors. It can also sing and dance. The singing is synthesized onboard the robot in real-time. Dancing can be performed in a synchronized group.</p>
